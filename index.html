							<h2><a href="#">HighLight: Nirupama Poojari</a></h2>
							<p>
								Poverty in India was high and the education provided to her wasn't the greatest expect for math and science. This is her story
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							One of the factor that led to her decisions in leaving is having 'more employment opportunities and quality education in the United States'. Her father talks of leaving the United States because of poverty. Her father made the decision to go to University of Cincinnati to get a degree. University of Cincinnati provided support for her fmaily, to the point where her father realized that they could move. As the Poojari family left to the United States to have a secure life, Nirupama was thrilled and nervous to move. Nirupama was able to achieve a quality education unlike in India. She currently attends the University of Miami in Oxford, Ohio.
